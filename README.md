# INTERACTIVE CLIENT ROOM
> Course: CSCI 2020U: Software Systems Development and Integration

The following application is a interactive chatroom where clients can chat to each other alongside playing games such as Rock Paper Scissors and having a fun time.

## Overview
* We coded our own application using Java web application.
* The chat room that we created uses websockets and HTML/Javascript/CSS.
* Our application allows multiple clients to chat in a room and play games at the same time.
* Lastly the user needs to be in a room for them to be able to send messages.
## HOW TO USE APPLICATION
**Connect to the websocket**
* 1st. git clone the repository
* 2nd. once you have configured and let the IDE install maven and all the necessary requirements
* 3rd. create a new local configuration of glassfish with the following configuration shown in (put img)

## Chat interaction and functionalities

The user must either establish or join an existing room in order to use the online application. The user can type in the code of a certain room they would like to join.
The user will be prompted to enter a username when entering a new room. The new user will be welcomed by the room. The server will also let individuals who were already in the room know that a new user has joined.
You will print the timestamp next to each chat message.When the user presses the enter key, the messages are sent. A "send" button is an optional addition.

**CREATE a new (unique) room code**
* Upon opening the application, enter a code, you will then either join a room that already exists in that name or create a new one.

**START a new game**
* Users will have the option to start a new game of rock paper scissors with the clients in the room, keep in mind there must be 2-3 clients in order to play.
## Happy Chatting!
